/// ## Update pubspec.yaml
///
/// Please make sure to update your pubspec.yaml to include the following
/// packages:
///
/// ```yaml
/// dependencies:
///   # Internationalization support.
///   flutter_localizations:
///     sdk: flutter
///   intl: any # Use the pinned version from flutter_localizations
///
///   # Rest of dependencies

///

/// locales, in an Info.plist file that is built into the application bundle.
/// To configure the locales supported by your app, you’ll need to edit this
/// file.
///
/// First, open your project’s ios/Runner.xcworkspace Xcode workspace file.
/// Then, in the Project Navigator, open the Info.plist file under the Runner
/// project’s Runner folder.
///
/// Next, select the Information Property List item, select Add Item from the
/// Editor menu, then select Localizations from the pop-up menu.
///
/// Select and expand the newly-created Localizations item then, for each
/// locale your application supports, add a new item and select the locale
/// you wish to add from the pop-up menu in the Value field. This list should
/// be consistent with the languages listed in the AppLocalizations.supportedLocales

Concerned about ads, paywalls, privacy risks, and apps shutting down, I decided to build my own — first as a small tool for myself and my family.\n\nIn September 2025, BeeCount launched its first version. Honestly, I had no idea if anyone would use it. But gradually, feedback started coming in — someone said they finally found a clean budgeting app, others offered great suggestions, and some quietly left five-star reviews. Every single message reminded me this was worth continuing.\n\nBeeCount is ad-free, subscription-free, and fully open source. All your data stays on your device and is never uploaded to any third-party server. But publishing and maintaining an app isn\'t free — developer accounts, servers, and other costs are currently covered by community donations, and every system update, bug fix, and new feature is built outside of my day job.\n\nIf BeeCount has been helpful to you, a rating, a share, or a donation would help this little project go further. Thank you for your trust.'**
